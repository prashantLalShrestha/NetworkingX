# Contributing to NetworkingX

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please follow existing conventions and style in order to keep readability of the code high.

## Pull requests

**Before** creating a pull request:

Updated to the latest version of the master branch (and branch out from that to avoid conflicts).
NetworkingX schemes compile successfully.
All unit tests in the NetworkingXTests project pass
The pull request contains a meaningful description explaining the problem the change solves and how the solution works

## Issues

If you find a bug in the project (and you don’t know how to fix it), have trouble following the documentation or have a question about the project, then please create an issue. Some tips from the [GitHub Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/):

- Check existing issues for the problem you're seeing. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re running in to has been addressed already.
- Be clear about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
- Include system details like the browser, library or operating system you’re using and its version.
- Paste error output or logs in your issue or in a Gist. If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks: so that it renders nicely.

## Contact

In case of major changes please feel free to reach out to the maintainers of the project at any time - we will be happy to help.
